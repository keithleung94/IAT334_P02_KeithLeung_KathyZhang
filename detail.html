				<h3>Nectarine Blossom & Honey Colonge</h3>
				<h4 class="rating">4.7/5 Rating</h4>
				<p>The essence of charm. Peonies in voluptuous bloom, exquisitely fragile.
					Flirtatious with the juicy bite of red apple and the opulence of jasmine, rose and gillyflower.
					Mingling with the sensuality of soft, blush suede. Luxurious and seductive.</p>

					<h3 class="review_title">5/5</h3>
					<h4 class="review_title">I would buy this for any woman in my life.</h4>
					<p class="review_body">One day when I went to check the mail, my life changed. A random fashion magazine came for my roommate that he did not order. Or at least, he said he did not order it. But that isn't what this review is about. Not really caring to improve my women's fashion knowledge, I went through the magazine looking for the scent samples. I found 5 in the magazine, but this perfume was by far, the best.
					Fast forward a 2 years and I had a girlfriend. What to get her? Call it selfish, but I wanted something that we both could enjoy. Looked back through some old photos to find out the name of this amazing fragrance and boom. Christmas done right. We broke up and sadly she did not return the perfume to me, but its fine, I can buy it for the next lady in my life. Women may break your heart, but this scent? It puts the pieces back together again.</p>

					<h3 class="review_title">3/5</h3>
					<h4 class="review_title">Smells great but lacks sillage/longevity.</h4>
					<p class="review_body">I love perfume in general so hopefully this review will help some people whether if they are debating on buying this or not.
					I fell in love with the scent of this one. I had smelled this originally in one of those little magazine ads but I wanted to wait to smell it in person just because those don't really do justice for how it really smells.
					Went to Kohls, tested it. Liked it and said I would eventually buy it for myself.
					The best way I can describe the scent is fruit that is sweet, soapy and powdery but doesn't scream sickly sweet. If you are into the whole fruity/gourmand perfumes such as myself, then this may be up your alley. Out of all Ariana's fragrances, this is one of her more mature scents. Not saying that's a bad thing. Not saying you'll smell like an old grandma either. However, I wouldn't recommend blind buying this if you haven't smelt it in person because everyone perceives scents differently.</p>

					<h4 class="review_title">One of my favorite perfumes now</h4>
					<p class="review_body">I went out on a limb and bought this without smelling it and it is TO DIE FOR! If you like Ariana Grande’s Sweet Like Candy, you will love this. I wear this everyday and get so many compliments. I’m kind of picky when it comes to perfumes (I never wore anything but Viva La Juicy) but this scent is amazing and it’s also half the price of Viva La Juicy.</p>
